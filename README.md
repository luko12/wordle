# Wordle

A Python implementation of the NYT Wordle game. See my first attempt in attempt.py, and an improved solution with explanation in solution.py. These implementations receive user inputs from the CLI.

Also note the wordle hack:
1. Obtain correct word of the day from [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
2. Right click window and View Page Source
3. Ctrl-F for the script tag with src = https://www.nytimes.com/games-assets/v2/wordle... ending in .js (not .css)
4. Click this link, then Ctrl-F for the correct word of the day to find the list of all wordle answers in daily sequence 

Enjoy :)

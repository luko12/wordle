"""
Explanation:
- First, create dictionary containing counts of each character in the correct word
- For each attempt, check each character within user input for exact match;
    update response and decrement dict if so
- On second pass, check if dict key has value > 0; update response and decrement
    dict if so
- Stop prompting user input if attempts exceeds 6 or if all dict values <= 0

Pitfalls:
- By decrementing the dict in the case of a correct character at wrong position,
    we lose the ability to display yellow again. Try "STOOL" then "WASNT": the "T"
    in WASNT is no longer reflected as yellow
- Haven't implemented error handling for valid inputs
- Time complexity is high because we iterate through each guess twice
